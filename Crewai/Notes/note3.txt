crew is a grp of gent, and every agent assign a task
crew ai is a multi agent framework, gpr of agnet, every agent assign a some task, to perform that task every agent given some tools


# Understand project folder
- Project/src/main.py
    BasicCrewai().crew().test(n_iterations=int(sys.argv[1]), eval_llm=sys.argv[2], inputs=inputs)
call crew like in django setting.py -> calling URL root


- Project/src/crew.py
    @agent -> is a decorator
if we declared this before function that that function is know as crew agent

- Project/src/config
@agent
def researcher(self) -> Agent:
    return Agent(
        config=self.agents_config['researcher'], # type: ignore[index]
        verbose=True
    )

this is config in Project/src/config/accroding_set.yaml


- project/src/crew.py
# assign a task
@task

# assign a crew 
@crew
